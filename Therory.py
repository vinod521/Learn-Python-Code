#The official date of birth for python is : Feb 20th 1991.
#Python is recommended as first programming language for beginners.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#Guido Developed python language by taking almost all programming features from different languages.

1.#Functional Programming Features from C.
2.#Objeect Oriented Programming Features from C++.
3.#Scripting Language Features from Perl and Shell Script.
4.#Modular Programming Features from Modula-3.

#//Most of syntax in python derived from C and ABC language.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Usage of Python Language

1. For developing Desktop Application.
2. For developing Web Application.
3. For Developing database Application.
4. For Network Programming.
5. For developing Games.
6. For Data Analysis Application.
7. For Machine Learning.
8. For developing AI application.

# How to different Python other language

1. #No Semi- Colon (;)

#Python uses new line to complete a command, as opposed to other programming language .Which often semicolons or parentheses.

2. #No Curly Braces ({})

#Python relies on indentation, using whitespace,to define scope;
#such as the scope of loops, function and classes. Other programming language often use curly - brackets for this purpose.


#First Chapter# Variables In Python #

#Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type,any can even change type after they have been set.

1. Camel case - nameofStudent
2. Pascal case - NameofStudent
3. Snake case - name_of_student


#Second Chapter# Identifiers in Python
